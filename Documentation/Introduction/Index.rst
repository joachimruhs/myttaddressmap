What does it do?
================

The extension enables you to show tt_address locations in responsive Google maps.
You can do a radial search for locations and display them in a list and a responsive Google map with Google infoWindows. 
The extension is based on multiple plugins. This way you can use more than one plugin of the extension on the same page. 
A single view of the location is implemented too, this can be used to display just a Google map without doing a search when the locationUid is given
in the constant editor of TYPO3. 

Within the Ajaxsearch you can show all address-POIs of a country if you leave the address field empty and select the country of your choice.
